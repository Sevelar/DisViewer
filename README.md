  Introducing: <b>DisViewer!</b> The live-preview text editor styled in fashioned Discord theme! This application uses frameworks like <a href="https://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React!</a> It shares a lot of functionality from its older predecessor, <a href="https://github.com/Sevelar/Discord-Previewer/">Discord Previewer.</a> 

This project is meant to be a part of the project focusing on creating a live-preview DC Markdown text editor, styled by Discord theme and Markdown styling. The old project will receive its final updates in near future, focusing on bug-fixing, maintaining decent security measures and eventually closing the first phase of the project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Install and Run

1. Clone the repository via Git and install all required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sevelar/DisViewer.git your-project-name
cd your-project-name
npm install
```

2. Once it's done, run the required scripts to get the application up and running:
```bash
npm start
npm electron
```

This should open a new Electron instance with the application ready to go.

## üîß Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm electron`

Opens the new Electron instance.<br />
Once you run the application in development mode, you can use this script in order to create an Electron instance to debug your code.<br />
<br />
Since this application was meant to be opened with Electron in mind, you'll need this script in order to successfully run the application.

### Remaining Scripts

You can find the list of remaining scripts in the [Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts).
