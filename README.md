  Introducing: <b>DisViewer!</b> The live-preview text editor styled in fashioned Discord theme. This application utilizes frameworks like <a href="https://electron.atom.io/">Electron.js</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a>. It shares a lot of functionality from its older predecessor, <a href="https://github.com/Sevelar/Discord-Previewer/">Discord Previewer.</a> 

This project is a direct successor to Discord Previewer. The old application will no longer receive any updates, while DisViewer will continue to be maintained and updated. Stay tuned for more updates.

This project uses [Vite tooling](https://vitejs.dev/) for testing and building web applications.
